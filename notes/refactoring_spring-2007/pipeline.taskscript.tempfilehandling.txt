Spring 2007 refactoring: taskscript tempfile handling
This email describes a refactoring towards script-defined temporary file handling.
Followups and status reports will be made in this thread.
Responsible for implementation: Linus
Implementation should be done by: end March. 

1. Problem 
There is currently no way to define in the taskscript how the taskscript deals with intermediary files created during multi-transformer script execution.
  
2. Solution  
	Extend the script file syntax by defining two new property types:
	
	 <tempFile name="file1" path="tempfile.xml" basedir="${outputPath}"/>
	 <tempDir name="dir1" path="tempdir" basedir="${outputPath}"/>
	 
	When a script finishes successfully, temporary files and/or directories are deleted.
