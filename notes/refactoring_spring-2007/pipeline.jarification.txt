Spring 2007 refactoring: jarification
This email describes a refactoring regarding jarification of core and transformers.
Followups and status reports will be made in this thread.
Responsible for implementation: Markus, with help from Linus
Implementation should be done by: end March. 

1. Problem 	
The server usecase (such as in Tomcat) needs jarness in order to be manageable. 
RCP inclusion is very much geared to expect everything to be Jars.

2. Solution 
  The core must be jarifiable. 
  Transformers should be jarifiable; however we must expect a slow transition of existing transformers.
  Its up to the creator of a server service (or any other context requiring jarness) to make sure all scripts used only use jarified transformers. 
  Also, we need to create a sister method to .getTransformerDirectory() which is something along the lines of InputStream .getTransformerResource(identifier)
  
  Note - org.daisy.util is more or less completely jarifiable already, and there is a fork of the core which is jarifiable too. 
  The major headache (and work) here lies at the transformer level.
