  <h1>Using the Open Document Format to dtbook transforms</h1>
  <p>How to write ODF documents that will easily transform into Daisy dtbook documents. A user guide.</p>
  <p>The structure of the Daisy dtbook file is directly derived from
  the styling information, which is derived from the styles you
  use. </p>

  <h2>Headings</h2>
  <p>ODF, like other office tools, has pre-defined levels of
  headings. In the styles and formatting menu (F11 to access), these
  are shown as <b>heading 1</b> through to <b>heading 9</b>. Use these
  headings. Do not create your own, either explicitly, or derived from
  the default headings. If that isn't good enough for you, write the
  Daisy version seperately. Remember that Daisy books aren't as
  visually pretty as your Office documents, they are meant to pass on
  information from their content. </p>
  <p>Any level beyond <b>heading 6</b> will be ignored. </p>
  <p>The first piece of content in the document must be a heading
  level 1, as required by dtbook. </p>
  <p>Headings must follow the principles set out in dtbook, i.e. after
  a level 1, the only valid headings are level 2 or another level 1
  heading. Don't omit levels. This is required by the transform, and
  makes sense stylistically. </p>

  <h2>Block level styling</h2>
  <p>Block level means the sequence of <b>paragraph</b> level items as
  the document is scanned top to bottom (in Western usage). If you set
  to on, the menu item view / non printing characters, control F10,
  then the presence or absence of the end of paragraph character
  indicates where the blocks end.</p>
  
  <p>In ODF, it is possible to have content which appears as a new
  block level item, but in fact is a continuation. For example, a
  small graphic with text following it visually looks like a new
  paragraph below the graphic. In fact by default in some office
  applications, the text is a continuation of the block (paragraph) in
  which the graphic is located. Place the cursor directly after the
  graphic and hit return to separate the blocks.</p>


  <h2>Using the script</h2>
  <p>A Unix script is provided named <code>odf2daisy</code>, which
  sequentially uses a series of transforms to generate the output file
  in Daisy dtbook format. Usage is</p>

<pre>
$>odf2daisy filename.odt
</pre>
<p>This produces an output file <code>filename.odt.xml</code> which is
the daisy file.</p>
