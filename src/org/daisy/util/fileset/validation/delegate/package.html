<body>
  An package for performing delegated fileset validation tasks.
  
  <p>A ValidatorDelegate typically performs <strong>one</strong> validation task on the Fileset
  instance registered with its owner Validator.</p>
  
  <p>Uses of <code>ValidatorDelegate</code>s are typically called for when schemas (which is 
  a Validators default modus operandi) can not perform the task at hand.</p>

  <p>A concrete implementation of <code>org.daisy.util.fileset.validation.Validator</code> may
  use statically assigned <code>ValidatorDelegate</code>s. It is also possible to attach additional
  delegates to a Validator at runtime using the setDelegate methods of the Validator.

  Given this, it is possible to extend a Validators behavior for localization and customization purposes.</p>
    
  <p>In the case several delegates are attached to a validator, no guarantees are given on the order of execution.</p>
  
  <p>Usage example:</p>
  	<code>
  		validator.setDelegate(myValidatorDelegateImpl);
  		validator.setDelegate("com.acme.myValidatorDelegateImpl");
  		validator.validate();
	</code>
	
  <p>The abstract Validator base class (org.daisy.util.fileset.validation.ValidatorImplAbstract) encapsulates all the
  code for registering and executing Delegates, so a concrete Validator implementation does not need any code to support this feature, apart
  from making sure to make a super call on the validate method, and to register any statically assigned <code>ValidatorDelegate</code>s at instantiation time.</p>
