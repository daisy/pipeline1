Spring 2007 refactoring: taskscript type properties
This email describes a refactoring towards extended strong typing in taskscripts.
Followups and status reports will be made in this thread.
Responsible for implementation: Linus
Implementation should be done by: end March. 

1. Problem 	
Currently, only input and output are defined properties for the GUI to expose to user. For configurability we need more properties such enum (dropdown/radio) and boolean (checkbox).
  
2. Solution  
	Extend the script file syntax to make it possible to define data types for the
	script parameters. Expose the data types through the API.
	
	Possible initial set of data types:
	 - file (browse button)
	 - string (text input box)
	 - boolean (checkbox)
	 - enum (dropdown/radio button)
	 - integer (spinner/scale)
