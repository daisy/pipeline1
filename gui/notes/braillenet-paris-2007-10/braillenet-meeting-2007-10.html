    <h2 id="thehlneserver">The "Hélène" server</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 different services:
<ul><li><em>Serveur Hélène</em>: to deliver content to transcripters / Braille producers</li><li><em>Bibliothèque Hélène</em>: a library service for users of an "IRIS" Braille refreshable display</li></ul></li>
      <li>simple user and admin interface (html + forms for the admin interface)</li>
      <li>each book is represented by a <em>book note</em> that contains:
<ul><li>the metadata</li><li>a preview of the book structure (in html)</li><li>a list of the several formats available</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="theproductionchain">The production chain</h2>
    <h3 id="initialimport">1. Initial import</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Receive the original file from publishers (usually in PDF)</li>
      <li>Print ToC for later use in the re-structuring phase</li>
      <li>Export to RTF using either:
<ul><li>Adobe Reader's export feature</li><li><a href="http://finereader.abbyy.com/">ABBYY Fine Reader</a> conversion tools (recommended, better conversion)</li></ul></li>
    </ol>
    <p>In parallel, a <em>book note</em> is first created on the server using the admin web interface (html form).
The original PDF is published on the server.</p>
    <h3 id="structuring">2. Structuring</h3>
    <p>The RTF created in phase 1 is then re-structured from scratch, using MS Word 2007. Default styles are used to map the original structure. The following structuring elements are processed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>headings</li>
      <li>tables</li>
      <li>footnotes</li>
      <li>links</li>
      <li>sometimes images (cut &amp; paste) + comment</li>
      <li>custom comments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that math formulas are not processed (yet).
Page breaks were supported but it seems it no longer works.</p>
    <p>A macro (for MS Word) is available to constrain the style of the doc (and later in phase 3 to connect to the server).
Problems of maintenance occurred (compatibility between Word versions).</p>
    <p>=&gt; Use the Pipeline to modernize the Word (or ODF?) to DTBook conversion?</p>
    <h3 id="conversiontoxml">3. Conversion to XML</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The custom macro connects to the server to link the RTF document with the book note.</li>
      <li>The structured DTBook-ready RTF is sent to the server</li>
      <li>The conversion to DTBook is launched manually from the web admin interface.</li>
      <li>Links can then be created to make other formats available with on-the-fly conversion. Available formats are:
<ul><li>single file HTML (for use in a browser)</li><li>multiple files HTML (for use with refreshable brailled displays)</li><li>large print PDF</li><li>Braille-adapted PDF</li></ul></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The RTF to DTBook conversion uses <a href="http://www.infinity-loop.de/products/upcast/">upCast</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>commercial (produced by a German company, Infinity Loop)</li>
      <li>causes some maintenance issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The DTBook to other format conversions use home made converters (using mostly XSLT).</p>
    <p>Note that the conversion to PDF used  <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</a> (Java-based XSL-FO to PDF) but should switch to <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">Prince XML</a> (better PDF accessibility features).</p>
    <h2 id="daisypipelinedemo">DAISY Pipeline demo</h2>
    <p>A short demo of the Pipeline was made: how to browse the documentation, how to create a Job, how to run a Job, how to analyze the messages.</p>
    <p>The Pipeline was then tested with some content produced by BrailleNet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Validation of a DTBook file produced by BrailleNet
<ul><li>almost OK :)</li><li>declaration of the MathML namespace raises a DTD validation error
<ul><li>the MathML namespace is not used </li></ul></li></ul></li>
      <li>RTF (formatted with the BrailleNet macro) to DTBook
<ul><li>OK</li><li>The book title is level 1, the remaining structure starts with level 2.
Note that BrailleNet didn't set the title as level 1, the whole structure is moved one level down.</li><li>xml:lang value is an empty string, causing validation problems</li></ul></li>
      <li>RTF (produced with Word 2007, no macro) to DTBook
<ul><li>same issues as with previous test</li></ul></li>
      <li>WordML to DTBook
<ul><li>had to tell Word 2007 to save as Word 2003 XML</li><li>images were not extracted</li></ul></li>
      <li>DTBook (produced by BrailleNet) to HTML
<ul><li>didn't work. The HTML tags seem to have not been output</li><li><span class="todo">[TODO]</span> report a bug and investigate.</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="questionsissuesraisedduringthedemo">Questions/issues raised during the demo</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Is the RTF to DTBook stable enough for production ?</li>
      <li>And WordML to DTBook ? ODF to DTBook ?</li>
      <li>Is there an OpenXML (or whatever it's called) transformer in development ? i.e. Will WordML to DTBook be upgraded to Word 2007 format ?</li>
      <li>What can be done to make images extracted by the WordML to DTBook transformer ?
<ul><li>the Pipeline doc describes a step-by-step pre-processing but it seems to be targeting Word 2003. </li><li>Word 2007 does not use an application menu but a ribbon (a mix between a menu and a toolbar), and the pre-processing couldn't be reproduced.</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="potentialuseofthepipelinebybraillenet">Potential use of the Pipeline by BrailleNet</h2>
    <p>BrailleNet could benefit from using the Pipeline:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>free open source software</li>
      <li>supported / maintained software (maintenance of the current macro / tools can be difficult by lack of developers)</li>
      <li>rely on the user / developer community</li>
      <li>quality insurance (validation)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Pipeline can definitely be used for RTF to DTBook conversion and for validation (replacement of the macro + upCast solution).
It can also potentially be used for on-the-fly conversion of the master DTBook to other formats (higher development cost).</p>
    <p>Two different issues at stake:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>integrating the Pipeline to the BrailleNet server-based conversion chain</li>
      <li>adapting the Pipeline transformers to BrailleNet needs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="integratingthepipelinetotheservertoolchain">Integrating the Pipeline to the server tool chain</h3>
    <p>The BrailleNet servers are implemented in Perl. There's no existing Java web container.</p>
    <p>The call to the Pipeline would be made internally, using the command line version. No need to have a full-blown server-side Pipeline with a servlet container.</p>
    <p>The potential move to OSGi (component framework) was raised. It's not a big deal for BrailleNet, the dynamic behavior is not a top priority requirement (low maintenance rate).</p>
    <h3 id="usingthepipelineforbraillenetconversions">Using the Pipeline for BrailleNet conversions</h3>
    <p>BrailleNet would need a ToC generator (for HTML generation). It would be easy to create one using existing XSLT-based ToC generators, and to write a script that optionally calls this task in the HTML converter.</p>
    <p>BrailleNet would need some custom options in the RTF to DTBook for creating metadata that could be used to link the produced DTBook to the book note on the server.</p>
    <p>BrailleNet could possibly contribute some XLST used in their current conversions.</p>
    <p>The Pipeline could potentially be used for all the conversions (including PDF generation). </p>
